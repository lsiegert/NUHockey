Android application for the Northeastern University men's ice hockey
team. Includes roster, schedule, RSS feed.  

I started this as my semester project for Martin Schedlbauer's spring
2011 Human/computer interaction course at Northeastern. We were allowed
to make an Android app as long as we used HCI concepts like prototyping
and evaluation. The main reason I wanted to do this app is that I wanted
an easier way to keep track of all the games I'd been to.

Main issue right now is getting the checkboxes on the schedule (used to
mark games as attended) to show the correct state. Checking one updates
the database automatically but sometimes if you scroll down the schedule
and then back up, the checked ones disappear.
