Android application for the Northeastern University men's ice hockey
team. Includes roster (temporarily removed), schedule, RSS feed, 
statistics about games you've attended.

I started this as my semester project for Martin Schedlbauer's spring
2011 Human/computer interaction course at Northeastern.
